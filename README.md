# MyKennelApp
Small project for my hobby, owner of a small poodle kennel.
Backend is private written in c#, frontend part is written in JavaScript(using ReactJS framework) and obviosly HTML/css.
Started learning react with JS in here and didn't like it, switched to TS
Leaving this app to see my mistakesand to improve
